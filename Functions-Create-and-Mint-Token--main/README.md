# Types of Functions - ETH + AVAX
A smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix

## DESCRIPTION
Written in Solidity, a programming language used to create smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, this program is a straightforward contract. The following are the functions of the contract:
1. the contract owner can mint tokens to a provided address and 
2. any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the code from contract.sol file into your file:

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to latest solidity version (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the your contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the requireInstance, assertInstance and revertInstance function.
